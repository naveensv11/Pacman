PACMAN

The code creates a basic animation of a Pac-Man image that moves horizontally across the screen.
The <button> starts the animation by setting isGameStarted to true, which triggers the movement and display of the Pac-Man image.
Two sets of images (Pac-Man facing right and left) are alternated using setInterval, changing Pac-Man's direction based on the screen boundaries.
Pac-Man moves at a constant speed (vel), reversing direction when it reaches the edges of the browser window.
The image source changes every 200ms, and Pac-Man's position is updated every 20ms to create a smooth animation.
